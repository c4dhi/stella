## 🏠 What is STELLA?

STELLA is an open-source platform for building, deploying, and testing voice-enabled conversational AI agents. Deploy an agent, have a conversation, iterate — it's that simple.

You bring the agent logic. STELLA handles the audio/video streaming, orchestration, and infrastructure. Built with **NestJS**, **React**, a **Python Agent SDK**, **LiveKit** for WebRTC, and **Kubernetes** for on-demand agent orchestration.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎙️ Voice & text conversations via WebRTC (LiveKit)
- ☸️ On-demand Kubernetes agent orchestration
- 🐍 Python Agent SDK with built-in STT/TTS pipeline
- 🤖 Multi-agent support (stella-v2, stella-light-agent, and custom agents)
- 🛡️ Expert Pool for safe handling of sensitive, high-stakes conversations
- 📋 Plan-driven conversation flows with state machine
- 🔐 Project & session management with role-based access
- 💬 Real-time transcript & event timeline
- 📊 Admin dashboard with live metrics
- 🚀 One-command deployment (`./scripts/start-k8s.sh`)

## ✅ Requirements

To run STELLA you need three things:

- **Docker** — [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev) (recommended) or [Docker Desktop](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on macOS, Docker Engine on Linux, or Docker via WSL2 on Windows
- **An OpenAI API key** — OpenAI is the default LLM provider (and powers the STT/TTS pipeline). Support for local models via [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and additional providers is on the way
- **A LiveKit server** — [LiveKit Cloud](https://livekit.io/cloud) (easiest) or [self-hosted](https://docs.livekit.io/home/self-hosting/local/), for real-time voice/video

That's it. Kubernetes (OrbStack's built-in cluster or auto-installed K3s), `kubectl`, and PostgreSQL are provisioned automatically by the startup script — you don't install them yourself.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Two commands. That's it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/c4dhi/stella.git && cd stella
./scripts/start-k8s.sh   # First run launches the setup wizard — no manual .env needed
```

**Frontend** at `http://localhost:5173` · **API** at `http://localhost:3000`

> New here? The [Getting Started](https://c4dhi.github.io/stella/docs/getting-started/prerequisites) guide walks you through everything — prerequisites, LiveKit setup, and deploying your first agent.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
LiveKit Server (external)  <-->  Agent Pods (Python)
         |                            |
   Frontend UI (React)  <-->  Backend API (NestJS)  <-->  PostgreSQL
         |
   STT/TTS Services (gRPC)
```

Everything runs inside a single **Kubernetes cluster** (OrbStack on macOS, K3s on Linux), deployed automatically by the startup script. Agent pods spin up on-demand per session and clean up after themselves.

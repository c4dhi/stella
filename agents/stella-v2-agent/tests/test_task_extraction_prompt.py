"""Guards for the task_extraction expert prompt (#278).

The deliverable-overwrite-on-correction behaviour is driven entirely by this
prompt plus the {{current_focus}} ALREADY COLLECTED section. These assertions
lock in the correction carve-outs so a future prompt edit can't silently drop
them (which is what let "running" survive a "oh no, I like basketball"
correction).

"""Regression tests for #236 — user speech captured during agent TTS must not
be processed as a user turn after the agent finishes speaking.

These exercise the turn-based path (barge-in OFF, the stopgap behaviour the
ticket describes): while the agent holds the floor (transcript gate closed),
final transcripts arriving from STT are dropped, never queued — so when TTS
ends there is no leftover "cached" user turn waiting to be processed.

The smart barge-in path (barge-in ON) deliberately does NOT drop overlap — it
routes it to on_barge_in() — and is covered by test_barge_in.py. When #15 fully
supersedes this stopgap, these tests (and the drop branch they pin) go away.

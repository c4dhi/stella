"""
AudioPipeline - High-level audio abstraction for STELLA agents.

This module provides the main audio interface that agents use. It orchestrates
the complete audio flow between LiveKit, STT service, TTS service, and the agent.

INPUT FLOW (user → agent):
1. Subscribe to LiveKit audio track
2. Stream audio to STT service (gRPC)
3. Publish partial transcripts to LiveKit (for frontend display)
4. Yield final transcripts to agent

OUTPUT FLOW (agent → user) - DECOUPLED:
1. publish_text() - Send text to frontend for display (independent of TTS)
2. enqueue_sentence() - Dispatch sentences to TTS as they complete (independent of frontend)
3. speak() - Send complete text to TTS (for non-streaming use cases)

The SDK's run_audio_loop handles the coordination:
- Stream text chunks to frontend immediately via publish_text()
- Detect sentence boundaries and dispatch each sentence to TTS immediately
- TTS synthesis starts on the first complete sentence, not on is_final

Usage:
    # In your agent's run_audio_loop:
    async for event in self.audio.audio_in():
        # Partials already published to LiveKit
        # event is guaranteed to be final

        # Agent yields text chunks
        accumulated = ""
        async for output in agent.process(input):
            accumulated += output.content
            await self.audio.publish_text(accumulated, output.is_final, transcript_id)

            if output.is_final:
                await self.audio.speak(accumulated)

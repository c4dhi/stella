"""Language resolver — single source of truth for the conversation language.

Without this, language tends to be decided several times independently within a
turn (an early bridge/ack heuristic, response-prompt inference, a static TTS env
var) and they can drift apart. This module collapses that into ONE resolved
language per turn that every consumer — the prompt's {{language}} directive and
TTS routing — reads, so the whole turn speaks one language.

Design (see RFC §8):
- Resolve from a per-turn ``(language, confidence)`` signal. For voice the
  signal is STT's independent acoustic detection (passed into ``resolve`` by the
  agent); for typed text it is the bundled ``detect_language`` text classifier.
  Both shapes are interchangeable — same gating, same propagation (§8.3).
- Hold a session lock; switch only on a sustained, high-confidence change
  (§8 confidence-gated switch). Short/ambiguous utterances never flip it.
- Clamp to the supported set — never resolve to a language we cannot speak (§7).
- Fallback chain: confident signal → session lock → plan seed → default.

Scope: the committed v1 supported set is ``en``/``de`` (RFC §7), so the bundled
detector is a focused, dependency-free en/de classifier that returns a usable
confidence. Swapping in a broader detector only changes ``detect_language``.

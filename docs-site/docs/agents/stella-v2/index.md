# stella-v2

A streamlined 5-stage voice AI pipeline with deterministic arbitration, parallel expert execution, and a configurable pipeline architecture.

## Why V2?

stella-agent (V1) routes messages through an **LLM-based Aggregator** that synthesizes expert findings into a final response. This works but introduces two problems:

1. **Latency**: The Aggregator adds ~500ms of LLM inference on top of expert execution, making the full UNSAFE path slow.
2. **Non-determinism**: Two identical expert outputs can produce different aggregated responses, making behavior hard to predict and debug.

stella-v2 replaces the Aggregator with **deterministic Arbitration** (~1ms) — a priority-based conflict resolver that selects the winning expert verdict and injects it as context into the Response Generator. This makes the pipeline faster and predictable.

V2 also adds a **Bridge Generator** that produces an ultra-short spoken phrase (e.g., "Good question.") immediately when the user stops speaking. This phrase is synthesized and played via TTS while the full pipeline runs in parallel, reducing perceived latency significantly.

## Pipeline Architecture

```

**Data flow:**
- **Input Gate → Expert Pool**: List of expert names to activate (e.g., `["medical", "probing"]`)
- **Expert Pool → Arbitration**: Structured `ExpertVerdict[]` with findings, confidence, and recommendations
- **Arbitration → Response Generator**: A single `ResponseDirective` containing the winning verdict, tone, and context
- **Bridge Generator → Response Generator**: A short bridge phrase spoken via TTS while the main pipeline runs; non-blocking

## Key Design Decisions

### Deterministic Arbitration over LLM Synthesis

V1's Aggregator uses an LLM to combine multiple expert findings into one response. This is flexible but slow and unpredictable. V2's Arbitration uses a fixed priority order (derived from expert configuration) to select the most important verdict. The Response Generator then crafts the final answer with the selected verdict as context injection. This is:
- **Fast**: ~1ms vs ~500ms
- **Predictable**: Same inputs always produce the same arbitration result
- **Debuggable**: You can trace exactly which expert "won" and why

### Parallel Expert Execution with Background Experts

All selected experts run via `asyncio.gather()` in parallel. Some experts (like `task_extraction`) are marked as **background experts** — their results are collected after the response is already being generated, so they don't add to response latency. This is useful for side-effect experts that extract structured data without influencing the spoken response.

### Sparse Configuration Overrides

Pipeline configurations store only the values that differ from defaults. The `pipelineSchema` in `agent.yaml` defines every configurable slot with its default value. A saved configuration might override just 2-3 slots out of 20+. This keeps configurations small, readable, and forward-compatible — when schema defaults change, only explicit overrides persist.

### gRPC State Machine

V1 runs the state machine locally inside the agent process. V2 delegates state management to a separate **gRPC StateMachineClient** service. This decouples conversation flow logic from agent processing, enabling shared state across services and independent scaling.

## Configuration

stella-v2 uses two configuration schemas in `agent.yaml`:

- **`configSchema`**: Top-level agent configuration (plan, LLM defaults, env vars). Includes `x-stella-supports-configurator: true` to enable the pipeline configurator.
- **`pipelineSchema`**: Defines the 5 pipeline nodes, their configurable slots, edges between them, and global thresholds.

Users create **Pipeline Configurations** — named, reusable presets that override specific slots. A configuration is **mandatory** when deploying stella-v2. See [Pipeline Configurator](/docs/agents/stella-v2/pipeline-configurator) for details.
